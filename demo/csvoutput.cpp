/*

    This demo shows how to use the cxxtools serialization to output results
    from the database in various formats.

    In the header <tntdb/serialization.h> are proper operators for converting
    tntdb::Value, tntdb::Row, tntdb::Result or tntdb::Statement to a
    cxxtools::SerializationInfo, which is needed to use the serialization
    of cxxtools.

    By default the csv serializer is used but also json and xml output are
    implemented.

    Note that reading a tntdb::Statements executes the sql when iterating
    through the result.
