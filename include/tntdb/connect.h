/** Establish a connection to a database

    The url is prefixed with a driver name followed by a colon and a
    driver-specific part.  If the connection can't be established, an
    exception derived from tntdb::Error is thrown.

    In the url the string "%u" is replaced with the username and "%p" is
    replaced with the password.  The password parameter and the url with the
    replaced username and password fields is never logged.

    To specify the text "%u" or "%p" in the connection string the '%' can be
    escaped with backslash like this: "\%u".

    Examples:

    @code
      tntdb::Connection sqConn = tntdb::connect("sqlite:mydatabase.db");
      tntdb::Connection pgConn = tntdb::connect("postgresql:dbname=DS2 user=%u passwd=%p", "web", "webpw");
      tntdb::Connection myConn = tntdb::connect("mysql:db=DS2;user=%u;passwd=%p", "web", "webpw");
      tntdb::Connection orConn = tntdb::connect("oracle:XE;user=%u;passwd=%p", "hr", "hr");
