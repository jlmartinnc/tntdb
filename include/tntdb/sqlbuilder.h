/** Helper class for building sql statements.

    Sql statments take placeholders, which can be filled with values for
    execution. Those placeholders are limited to take scalar values and only
    where scalar values are expected in the sql statement.

    Sometimes the user needs to pass sets of values. Since it is not directly
    supported by sql the user has to build a list of placeholders into the
    sql statement. If the number of needed placeholders is not known at
    compile time, a sql statement needs to be created dynamically.

    Anoter problem is, that placeholders are not allowed everywhere in the
    sql statment. To parametrise e.g. the table name, again the user has to
    replace the table name before passing the sql to the database.

    This class has helpers for both cases.

    Placeholders here start with a percent character followed by alphanumeric
    characters.

    /** Replace a sqlbuilder placeholder with a list of sql placeholders with index.

        The varname specifies the placeholder and the count the number of
        generated placeholders.

        example:

        @code
          std::set<int> myValues;
          myValues.insert(2);
          myValues.insert(3);
          myValues.insert(6);

          st.set("set", s);
          // => select foo from bar where baz in (:set1,:set2,:set3)
        @endcode

        This generates a sql statement with 3 sql placeholders and fills
        those with values from a std::set.

    /** Replace a placeholder with a value.

        This method replaces a sqlbuilder placeholder with a value.
        Note that no escaping is done so that passing user input may result
        in sql injection.

        example:

        @code
          std::string myTablename = "bar";
          tntdb::Statement st = conn.prepare(
              tntdb::SqlBuilder(
                  "select foo from %tab")
                      .replace("tab", myTablename)
              );
          // => select foo from bar
        @endcode

     */
    SqlBuilder& replace(const std::string& varname, const std::string& value);

    /** Replace a placeholder conditionally with a value.

        This adds a condition to the replace method. This helps when optional
        conditions are needed.

        @code

          std::string searchString = "";
          tntdb::Statement st1 = conn.prepare(
              tntdb::SqlBuilder(
